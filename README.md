## Iter2:

### Progress

For this iteration, I worked on the backend CRUD APIs.

1. The GET api is used to fetch a batch of 10 most recent messages. When the user chooses to 'load more', 10 more messages are fetched in the descending order of their timestamp. 

In the below screenshot, I have fetched the 10 most recent messages from the group with a groupId - 573a1390f29313caabcd42e8.

2. The POST api is used to post a new message into a group chat.

In the below screenshot, I have posted a message to the group whose groupId is: 573a1390f29313caabcd42e8.

3. The DELETE api is used to delete a message from a group.

In the below screenshot, I have deleted a message (messageId: 64d5d1ebfec65c5e50987dc4) from the group whose groupId is: 573a1390f29313caabcd42e8.

### Issues/Concerns:

Although working as expected with my localhost:5001 endpoints, when deployed to Google Cloud the app's apis are not returning the desired results. I will shortly make a Piazza post explaining the issue to the Professor and the TAs.
